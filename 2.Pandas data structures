Pandas Data Structures
Pandas has two primary data structures:

Series - 1-dimensional labeled array

DataFrame - 2-dimensional labeled data structure (like a spreadsheet)

Series
A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object containing a sequence of values and an associated array of data labels (its index).

Creating a Series:

import pandas as pd

# From a list
s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
print(s)

# With custom index
s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])
print(s)

# From a dictionary
data = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30}
s = pd.Series(data)
print(s)
Series Attributes and Methods

s.values  # Get the values as numpy array
s.index   # Get the index
s.head()  # Show first few rows
s.tail()  # Show last few rows
